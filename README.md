# SAS Customer Intelligence 360 Mobile SDK for iOS

## Overview

The mobile SDK for SAS Customer Intelligence 360 is a supporting library that enables a mobile app developer to add support for event collection and managed content to your native mobile applications (apps). Marketers, business analysts, and designers can use collected events to understand how the mobile app is performing and easily target users for content distribution.

Here are some benefits that the mobile SDK provides:

- minimizes overhead on both the development and usage of your native mobile app.
- collects behavioral and response data about mobile app usage.
- has built-in abilities to track geofences and beacons if your company needs to support these.
- along with SAS Customer Intelligence 360, enables developers and marketers to create their own custom events and to support several built-in system events.
- allows marketers and other business users to publish standard and personalized content to the mobile app without the need to involve mobile app development teams or IT.
